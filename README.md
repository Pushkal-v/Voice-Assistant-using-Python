# Voice-Activated Personal Assistant

This is a Python-based **Voice-Activated Personal Assistant** project that can perform tasks such as setting reminders, checking the weather, and reading the news. It also includes a text-based assistant as a fallback in case voice input is not available.

## Features

- **Voice Assistant:** Interact with the assistant using your voice.  
- **Text Assistant:** Use commands via text if the microphone or voice recognition fails.  
- **Help Command:** Say or type `help` to display the wake words that trigger the assistant.  
- **Diagnostic Modules:** Includes `microphone_diagnostic.py` and `test_tts.py` to troubleshoot common issues during setup.  

## Notes

- The `requirements.txt` file is not included yet but will be updated soon.  
- This project uses **Python TTS engine**, **Speech Recognition**, and **APIs for weather and news updates**.
